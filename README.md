# se_allow_in_space
Compatibility patch for Space Exploration (by Earendel https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration)

Allows some entities from other mods to be built in space.

Currently allows Memory Storage (by notnotmelon https://mods.factorio.com/mod/deep-storage-unit) containters (and all of it's sub-mods) to be build in space.
